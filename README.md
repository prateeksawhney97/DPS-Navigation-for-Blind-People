## Object Detection - Computer Vision

### Technologies Used:

##### There are two types of technologies used in the research paper. One of them is assisting the blind people using IR (Infrared Rays). The IR Ray will be reflected back from the obstacle in front of the person and a beep sound would be produced so as to draw his attention that something is there in front of him.
