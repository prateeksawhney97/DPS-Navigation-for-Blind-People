## Object Detection - Computer Vision

### Technologies Used:

##### There are two types of technologies used in the research paper. One of them is assisting the blind people using IR (Infrared Rays). The IR Ray will be reflected back from the obstacle in front of the person and a beep sound would be produced so as to draw his attention that something is there in front of him.


### Technology I am interested in!



##### There is an Android application that continuously records video of the surrounding in front of the blind person. There is a Machine Learning model that is running continously in the backend that recognises various objects like Tables, Stairs, chairs, etc. and gives output to the user whenever there is something in front of him/her. The output is in the form of a beep or alteration can be made to give the output as a voice message of what the object really is!

### Future Scope:

##### This approach can further be used in grocery stores to distinguish various articles in the store. The person suffering from blindness can navigate through the store and the Machine Learning model using Computer Vision can detect various items in the grocery store. For this a large dataset of various household as well as as shopping (grocery stores) items is necessary so as to make the algorithm function exceptionally well. Further, several techniques of increasing the accuracy could be achieved once we acquire a large dataset for training.


##### I would like to work on this part of recognising various items using object detection and other techniques and integrate that backend part with the frontend.
